## 2025

**October**
I will be speaking in the [Stochastic Analysis Seminar](https://orfe.princeton.edu/events/2025/benjamin-zhang-university-north-carolina-chapel-hill) in the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University. 


**September**

Happy to announce that our paper [Optimal Control for Transformer Architectures: Enhancing Generalization, Robustness and Efficiency.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13499) has been accepted to NeurIPS 2024 through the Main Track! 


New preprint on applications of generative modeling to operator learning! In [Probabilistic operator learning: generative modeling and uncertainty quantification for foundation models of differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05186), we place operator learning within the framework of probabilistic machine learning through a random differential equations formalism. We show that in-context operator learning (ICON) performs Bayesian inference implicitly and demonstrate how generative modeling provides uncertainty quantification for predictions made by ICON. This is joint work with [Siting Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/sitingl), [Stan Osher](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sjo/), and [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/). 



**August**
I have moved to the School of Data Science and Society at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a postdoctoral research associate. 

**July**
Our paper [Nonlinear denoising score matching for enhanced learning of structured distributions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782525004980) has been accepted to *Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering* in their special issues on [Generative Artificial Intelligence for Predictive Simulations and Decision-Making in Science and Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/109BSBSP137). 


I will be attending and presenting in the [IPAM Workshop on Sampling, Inference, and Data-Driven Physical Modeling in Scientific Machine Learning](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/sampling-inference-and-data-driven-physical-modeling-in-scientific-machine-learning/). 




**May**
Three new preprints! 

In [Particle exchange Monte Carlo methods for eigenfunction and related nonlinear problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23456), we introduce a novel particle exchange Monte Carlo method that provide stochastic representations of eigenvalue problems related to generators of diffusion processes. We also discuss applications for approximating quasistationary distributions and ergodic stochastic control. This is joint work with [Paul Dupuis](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/people/paul-dupuis). 

In [Optimal control for Transformer architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13499), we provide a framework for understanding transformer neural network architectures using tools from optimal control theory. We provide theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments showing how optimal control ideas can enhance generalization, robustness, and training efficiency of transformers. This is joint work with [Kelvin Kan](https://www.math.emory.edu/~kkan5/), [Xingjian Li](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Xingjian-Li/), [Tuhin Sahai](https://tuhinsahai.github.io), [Stan Osher](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sjo/), and [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/). 

In [Proximal optimal transport divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12097), we introduce a new class of probability divergences based on the infimal convolution of divergences and optimal transport distances, including Wasserstein distances. These distances inherits the desirable properties of information divergences and transport distances, and we discuss how they are frequently unknowingly employed in generative modeling. This is joint work with [Panagiota Birmpa](https://sites.google.com/site/panagiotabirmpa/home), [Ricardo Baptista](https://www.ricardobaptista.com), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), and [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/).

New preprint on structure-preserving generative modeling! In [Equivariant score-based generative models provably learn distributions with symmetries efficiently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01244), we prove generalization bounds for equivariant score-based generative modeling and provably show that the frequently applied practice of data augmentation is inferior to using an explicitly equivariant score function when learning distributions invariant to a group. This work builds upon the PDE theory approach to analysis of generative models [Score-based generative models are provably robust: an uncertainty quantification perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15754). This is joint work with [Ziyu Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/ziyu-chen) and [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/).

**August**: I have moved to the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. This is the continuation of the same AFOSR postdoc I started at UMass Amherst. My mentors as Paul Dupuis, Markos Katsoulakis, and Luc Rey-Bellet. This year, the focus will be on interacting particle methods for sampling and stochastic control. 



**July**: Excited to announce a new preprint: [Combining Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 proximals: robust manifold learning via well-posed generative flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11901). We introduce a generative flow trained on the combination of Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 proximal of $f$-divergences. While optimal transport cost (Wasserstein-2 proximals) have been used to stabilize the training of generative flows, they still struggle to learn high-dimensional data supported on low-dimensional manifolds. Our new $\mathcal{W}_1\oplus\mathcal{W}_2$ generative flow learning distributions without densities using Wasserstein-1 proximals of the KL divergence. This is joint work with [Hyemin Gu](https://hyemingu.github.io), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), and [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/). 


**May**: Excited to announce two new preprints! In [Score-based generative models are provably robust: an uncertainty quantification perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15754), we prove SGM generalization bounds in terms of integral probability metrics using regularity theory of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and an novel uncertainty propagation perspective. This is joint work with [Nikiforos Mimikos-Stamatopoulos](https://math.uchicago.edu/~nmimikos/) and [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/). 


In [Nonlinear denoising score matching for enhanced learning of structured distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15625), we propose SGMs with *nonlinear* forward processes, which produces structure-preserving generative models. A nonlinear implementation of denoising score-matching is developed to facilitate the use of nonlinear processes. This is joint work with [Jeremey Birrell](https://people.umass.edu/jbirrell/), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/), and [Wei Zhu](https://people.math.umass.edu/~zhu/). 

**February**: I am co-organizing a minisymposium at [SIAM UQ 2024](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/uq24) titled [Optimal Transport for Uncertainty Quantification](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=78505) with [Panagiota Birmpa](https://sites.google.com/site/panagiotabirmpa/home). I will also be presenting in the [Computational Transport](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=78494) minisymposium  where I will be presenting on our recent work relating mean-field games with generative modeling. 


I am excited to announce our new preprint title [Wasserstein proximal operators describe score-based generative models and resolve memorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06162). We show that score-based generative models can be fundamentally understood as the Wasserstein proximal operator of cross-entropy and we build informed models that resolve the memorization phenomenon in SGMs. This is joint work with [Siting Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/siting6ucla/home), [Wuchen Li](https://people.math.sc.edu/wuchen/), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), and [Stan Osher](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sjo/).

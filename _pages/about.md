I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.math.umass.edu) at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu) working with [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/), and [Paul Dupuis](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/people/paul-dupuis). My research interests broadly lie in the **mathematics of machine learning**, in particular analyzing and developing **generative modeling** algorithms, from the perspectives of **mathematical control theory** and **mean-field games**. I also develop mnovel algorithms in **rare event simulation for dynamical systems** and **sampling methods for Bayesian computation** using tools from generative flows. 



<!-- My research lies at the intersection of **computational statistics** and **computational dynamics**. I enjoy studying how these two fields interact with and complement each other for predictive modeling and uncertainty quantification.  -->

I earned my PhD in Computational Science and Engineering from MIT in 2022. My advisor was [Youssef Marzouk](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/youssef-m-marzouk/) who heads the [Uncertainty Quantification group](https://uqgroup.mit.edu). I earned my Master's degree in Aeronautics & Astronautics at MIT in 2017, and my Bachelor's degrees in Engineering Physics and Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley in 2015. I was a [MIT School of Engineering 2019-2020 Mathworks Fellow](https://engineering.mit.edu/students/graduate-student-fellowships/mathworks-fellows/). I spent the summer of 2017 as a research intern at United Technologies Research Center (now Raytheon), where I worked with [Tuhin Sahai](https://tuhinsahai.github.io/) on novel queuing systems.

## Learning *Learning*
I am the co-organizer of the [Learning *Learning*](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/seminars/learning-learning-seminar) seminar, along with [Hyemin Gu](https://hyemingu.github.io). This is an internal seminar at UMass Amherst where graduate students and postdocs discuss latest developments in machine learning and data science through reading groups and tutorials. It is also a venue for students to present their research. Please contact us if you wish to participate in the group! 


## Recent news & upcoming events 

**July**: Excited to announce a new preprint: [Combining Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 proximals: robust manifold learning via well-posed generative flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11901). We introduce a generative flow trained on the combination of Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 proximal of $f$-divergences. While optimal transport cost (Wasserstein-2 proximals) have been used to stabilize the training of generative flows, they still struggle to learn high-dimensional data supported on low-dimensional manifolds. Our new $\mathcal{W}_1\oplus\mathca{W}_2$ generative flow learning distributions without densities using Wasserstein-1 proximals of the KL divergence. This is joint work with [Hyemin Gu](https://hyemingu.github.io), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), and [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/). 

**May**: Excited to announce two new preprints! In [Score-based generative models are provably robust: an uncertainty quantification perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15754), we prove SGM generalization bounds in terms of integral probability metrics using regularity theory of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and an novel uncertainty propagation perspective. This is joint work with [Nikiforos Mimikos-Stamatopoulos](https://math.uchicago.edu/~nmimikos/) and [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/). 


In [Nonlinear denoising score matching for enhanced learning of structured distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15625), we propose SGMs with *nonlinear* forward processes, which produces structure-preserving generative models. A nonlinear implementation of denoising score-matching is developed to facilitate the use of nonlinear processes. This is joint work with [Jeremey Birrell](https://people.umass.edu/jbirrell/), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/), and [Wei Zhu](https://people.math.umass.edu/~zhu/).

<!-- **February**:

I am excited to announce our new preprint title [Wasserstein proximal operators describe score-based generative models and resolve memorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06162). We show that score-based generative models can be fundamentally understood as the Wasserstein proximal operator of cross-entropy and we build informed models that resolve the memorization phenomenon in SGMs. This is joint work with [Siting Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/siting6ucla/home), [Wuchen Li](https://people.math.sc.edu/wuchen/), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), and [Stan Osher](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sjo/).  -->

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

------
More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.

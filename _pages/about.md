I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [School of Data Science and Society](https://datascience.unc.edu) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) working with [Amarjit Budhiraja](https://abudhiraja.web.unc.edu). My research topics lie broadly in the intersections of **mathematics of machine learning,** **mathematical control theory,** and **Bayesian computation**.  

I was previously a postdoctoral research associate between the [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) and the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/) at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu) with [Paul Dupuis](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/people/paul-dupuis), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/).

I earned my PhD in Computational Science and Engineering from MIT in 2022. My advisor was [Youssef Marzouk](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/youssef-m-marzouk/) who heads the [Uncertainty Quantification group](https://uqgroup.mit.edu). I earned my Master's degree in Aeronautics & Astronautics at MIT in 2017, and my Bachelor's degrees in Engineering Physics and Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley in 2015. I was a [MIT School of Engineering 2019-2020 Mathworks Fellow](https://engineering.mit.edu/students/graduate-student-fellowships/mathworks-fellows/). I spent the summer of 2017 as a research intern at United Technologies Research Center (now Raytheon), where I worked with [Tuhin Sahai](https://tuhinsahai.github.io/) on novel queuing systems.

## Recent News

**September**

Happy to announce that our paper [Optimal Control for Transformer Architectures: Enhancing Generalization, Robustness and Efficiency.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13499) has been accepted to NeurIPS 2024 through the Main Track! 


New preprint on applications of generative modeling to operator learning! In [Probabilistic operator learning: generative modeling and uncertainty quantification for foundation models of differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05186), we place operator learning within the framework of probabilistic machine learning through a random differential equations formalism. We show that in-context operator learning (ICON) performs Bayesian inference implicitly and demonstrate how generative modeling provides uncertainty quantification for predictions made by ICON. This is joint work with [Siting Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/sitingl), [Stan Osher](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sjo/), and [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/). 


**August**

I have moved to the School of Data Science and Society at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a postdoctoral research associate. 

**July**

Our paper [Nonlinear denoising score matching for enhanced learning of structured distributions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782525004980) has been accepted to *Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering* in their special issues on [Generative Artificial Intelligence for Predictive Simulations and Decision-Making in Science and Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/109BSBSP137). 

<!-- 
**May** 

Three new preprints! 

In [Particle exchange Monte Carlo methods for eigenfunction and related nonlinear problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23456), we introduce a novel particle exchange Monte Carlo method that provide stochastic representations of eigenvalue problems related to generators of diffusion processes. We also discuss applications for approximating quasistationary distributions and ergodic stochastic control. This is joint work with [Paul Dupuis](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/people/paul-dupuis). 

In [Optimal control for Transformer architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13499), we provide a framework for understanding transformer neural network architectures using tools from optimal control theory. We provide theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments showing how optimal control ideas can enhance generalization, robustness, and training efficiency of transformers. This is joint work with [Kelvin Kan](https://www.math.emory.edu/~kkan5/), [Xingjian Li](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Xingjian-Li/), [Tuhin Sahai](https://tuhinsahai.github.io), [Stan Osher](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sjo/), and [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/). 

In [Proximal optimal transport divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12097), we introduce a new class of probability divergences based on the infimal convolution of divergences and optimal transport distances, including Wasserstein distances. These distances inherits the desirable properties of information divergences and transport distances, and we discuss how they are frequently unknowingly employed in generative modeling. This is joint work with [Panagiota Birmpa](https://sites.google.com/site/panagiotabirmpa/home), [Ricardo Baptista](https://www.ricardobaptista.com), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), and [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/).

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
 -->
<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk

For more info
------
More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
